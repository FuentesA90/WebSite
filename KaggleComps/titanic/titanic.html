<h1>The Titanic Dataset - Machine Learning From Disaster</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I will  to build my personal model for the Titanic Disaster famously hosted on Kaggle.
    To begin, I will provide a brief description of the objective of the competition.
 </p>
    <p>The objective of this Kaggle competition is successfully predict how many passengers survived Titanic disaster. 
        A dataset is provided with various variables. The target/response/independent variable is a binary response variable describing whether
        the passenger survived (1) or perished (0).
</p>
<p>I will attempt to use the R statistical software as well as Python to devlop the models.</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>As is typically provided by Kaggle. Two datasets in csv formats are available to download.</p>
<p>The training set consists of 891 observations with 10 predictor/dependent variables and 1 independent variable “Survived". </p>
<p>The test set consists of 418 observations with 10 predictor/dependent variables, the missing variable is the independent “Survived".</p>
<p>The overall predictor/dependent variables are as follows:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>survival:</strong> 0=No, 1=Yes</li>
        <li><strong>pclass:</strong> Ticket Class (1 = 1st Class, 2 = 2nd Class, 3 = 3rd Class)</li>
        <li><strong>sex:</strong> male/female</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Age of passenger (float)</li>
        <li><strong>sibsp:</strong> # of Siblings</li>
        <li><strong>parch:</strong> # of Parents</li>
        <li><strong>ticket:</strong> Ticket number</li>
        <li><strong>fare:</strong> Passenger fare</li>
        <li><strong>cabin:</strong> Cibin number</li>
        <li><strong>embarked:</strong> Port of Embarkation (C = Cherourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)</li>
</ul>
